    This is just a place to put some information.
    This is not a finished product at all, I have old code in the mcshOLD package until this is completly done.
    ONLY USE GSON FOR JSON, if you don't like it deal with it, I wont accept a pull request otherwise.
    DO NOT MESS WITH THE MCVERSIONS.JSON WITHOUT PUTTING WHAT YOU HAVE CHANGED AND WHY YOU CHANGED IT!
