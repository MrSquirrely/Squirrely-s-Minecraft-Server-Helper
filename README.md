Squirrely's Minecraft Server Helper or MCSH
============================================
This is a simple server helper I am creating! I have a lot I wish to do with this!
The current version is 0.5.0 InDev.

Some Question you might have:
- Can I fork this code? Yes! As long as you follow the license! Which is GPL V3.0 (http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
- How can I submit a bug? Just click the issues and submit one through there!
- How can I submit a bug fix? Just fork, fix, and submit a pull request! You have to follow my formating though, don't change it please.
- Why did you make this? Originaly I did it for some practice and I hated setting up MineCraft server... now, because I can.
- Does Port Forword really work? Right now no, if I add it later... I don't know...
